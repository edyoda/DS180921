1.) Write a Python program to filter a list of integers using Lambda.
Original list of integers:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Even numbers from the said list:
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
Odd numbers from the said list:

2) Write a Python program to cube every number in a given list of integers using Lambda.
Original list of integers:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

Cube every number of the said list:
[1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, 1000]
